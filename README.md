A demo Next.js project to test deployments with [OpenNext](https://opennext.js.org/) and [SST](https://sst.dev/)

# Deployment

- Clone the repo
- Tnstall node_modules using ```npm install```
- Deploy the app using ```npx sst deploy --stage production``` (You should have AWS CLI installed and credentials configured. SST uses these credentials)
- If the sst command doesn't work for you using npx, you can also install the SST CLI. For more info, check [SST](https://sst.dev/)
